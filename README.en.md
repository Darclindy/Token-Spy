# Installation Environment

venv is one of Python's standard libraries for creating lightweight virtual environments. Here are the steps to create and use a virtual environment:

Installing Python
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Python website. The Python version used for this project is:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.10.12
(.venv)

pip 22.0.2 from /home/clindy/py-program/Token-Spy/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)
(.venv)

```

Creating a Virtual Environment
Open the command line tool, then run the following commands in the repository directory to create a virtual environment:

```bash
# path/to/python3.10 is the path to the specified Python interpreter
# To ensure a consistent environment, you can do it this way
path/to/python3.10 -m venv .venv

# If the environment consistency is not a concern, you can use
python -m venv .venv
```

Activating the Virtual Environment
The method to activate the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

Windows:

```bash
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Installing Necessary Python Packages
In the virtual environment, you can use pip to install necessary Python packages,

```bash
pip install .
```

## Configuring API Token

Project data is obtained through platforms like Dune, CMC, Helius, etc., and requires the use of a platform Token.
For general projects, the number of free uses provided by the platform is usually sufficient. Before using the project, it is recommended to obtain the relevant Token from the platform and enter it into `.env.example`, then rename `.env.example` to `.env.`

## Running Examples

```bash
$ token-spy-test
this is a setup test.
(.venv)
```
